## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS
- CSS pseudo elements (::after, ::before)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Web Design
- Re-usable components
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The dask provided a training groud for the Vue.js framework. I tried to build as many re-usable components as possible. There was a good space to test my SCSS skills, this was not first time I've touched this CSS preprocessor but I'm not quite confident with it. I've used many of pseudo elements and I think that's work out.
